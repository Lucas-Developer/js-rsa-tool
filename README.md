# Javascript RSA encryption/decryption and prime generation

This is a little tool I wrote a little while ago during a course that explained how RSA works. The course wasn't just theoretical, but we also needed
 to decrypt simple RSA messages. Given that I don't like repetitive tasks, my decision to automate the decryption was quickly made. 
 
 ## Notes
 
 The code is not guaranteed to work (though it worked in all the cases I've tried so far), and especially the prime number "generator" is crudely constructed. It
 probably could be done way better, but it's no priority for me. Feel free to make a pull request to improve it ;)
